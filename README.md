## About the App

This is the frontend code of the MyBookList App where users can have an account to store and edit a list of books. They can also see a general list of all users' books.

In the app, users can register and log in. After logging in, they can access the general list of books from their profile. There is a tab for adding books with references, title, author, genre, description, year, and a numerical rating from 0 to 5. 

Users can view this list of books in their profile, edit the data, delete the books they no longer want, and log out of the app.
